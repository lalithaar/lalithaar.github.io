            <h3>[JEE] Hey, It's okay to feel lost</h3>
            <h4>Published: 16 Oct 2024</h4>
            <p>Recently a friend of mine reached out saying. </p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>‚ÄúI wanted to ask something, I failed in all the three subjects in half yearly school examination. I‚Äôm thinking to step back ..stepping back from preparing for jee 2026‚Äù</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I know many of us are in a similar situation, </p>
            <p>‚ÄúYou still have more than a year to go before your jee I would say a more important question to ask yourself will be, do I want to do this?</p>
            <p>Do you want to study engineering? Do you want to study at IIT because you truly like the subject and want to delve deeper or because of the societal pressure? Both are not wrong, it's just the way we are taught - so don't blame yourself.</p>
            <p>Do you think you want to learn these topics in such depth? Do you wish to? If no one is going to ask you what exams you are writing or what college you go to, would you still prepare for this exam just because you want to? Leave out how well you are studying at the moment, if you think you can do it, etc., just "Will I still prepare for jee ?‚Äù</p>
            <p>Will you?</p>
            <p>Her answer: Yes</p>
            <p>There we go is your answer</p>
            <p>Forget about the results, what if I didn't get to x branch or x university</p>
            <p>I know there's alot of pressure around this, it's too hyped</p>
            <p>But try to focus on learning the subject in depth instead, ik it's easy to say but much harder to execute But practise is the way to go</p>
            <p>What's your dream branch?</p>
            <p>Her answer: cse</p>
            <p>Great, now just try to understand the subjects in depth On the fact that one day you will create impact, this knowledge will help you do that Maybe make someone more happier, make someone feel loved, or even save lives</p>
            <p>When we feel we aren't good enough, instead of thinking about ourselves. Thinking about how much it would help others helps a lot</p>
            <p>Let's say you are a med student, even if you failed the exam -</p>
            <p>The fact that you knowing how to do CPR could save someone's life, could save a family from grief</p>
            <p>Talking on CSE, who knows you may create software that makes women feel safe walking on roads Isn't that amazing? Even if you failed on the exam by Societal standards It won't change the fact that you will save someone's life, this knowledge will help you do so</p>
            <p>So shift your focus on the impact you can make with this knowledge Ik the journey gets really hard, but just please hold on to the fact that - another day is always gonna come, and you are always going to feel better than you are feeling right now I am so proud of you, hold on okay?</p>
            <p>Remember that you are so loved, you are so worthy of that love and existence And no marks you score can ever change that</p>
            <p>It will all be okay If you ever want to rant, my DM‚Äôs are always open &lt;3</p>
            <p>Until then, please hold on - everything will be okay &lt;3</p>          </div>

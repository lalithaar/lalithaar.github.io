            <p>
                The <strong>Journal of Kanha-Induced Cognitive Collapse (JKICC)</strong> is a scholarly publication dedicated to the study of 
                the profound and often irrecoverable impact of Kanha’s existence on human cognition. Our peer-reviewed papers rigorously examine 
                the <b>statistical, mathematical, and phenomenological underpinnings</b> of this phenomenon.
